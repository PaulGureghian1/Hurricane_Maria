## Status Puerto Rico

This page tracks key indicators of progress in water, communications, hospitals, and shelters during Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria. The data here are pulled from the goverment webpage [StatusPR](http://status.pr/). Progress on re-enerigizing the island is shown on the [Re-energinzing Puerto Rico](Electricity.md) page. 

The last update of this page was on October 26, 2017 - 35 days after the hurricane.

#### Water supply

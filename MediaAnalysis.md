## Hurricane Media Coverage Updates

Initial media coverage of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma was much higher than coverage of Hurricane Maria (see figures below). Likewise, in the states which Harvey and Irma hit hardest, Texas and Florida, initial coverage related to those states was much higher than for Puerto Rico where Maria has the most significant impact. Generally media coverage of Texas and Florida tends to be higher than Puerto Rico, yet clear increases were evident up to roughly 2 weeks after landfall. For Puerto Rico, coverage never reached the peak intensity of the two states, but there has been sustained reporting as the crisis in Puerto Rico continues. However, even that coverage has substantially decreased despite the slow progress in restoring essential services in Puerto Rico (e.g. [the lack of electricity](Electricity.md)).
